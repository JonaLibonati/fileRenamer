# fileRenamer.py
The py script allows to append a word to the name of multiple files.  

## Running the script
The script uses as an input a directory within the files to rename.  

Run the script by using the [dir-path] as a parameter within the files to rename:  
```

```
For example, if you are located in the script folder:
```
python3 filesRenamer.py <dir-paht>
